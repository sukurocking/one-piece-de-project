- [x] Scrape One Piece episodes tabular data from https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/one-piece-ratings-17673/ (Check if API is available, if not scrape)
    - Scraping the table does not seem to be feasible
    - Maybe take temporary data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditya2803/one-piece-anime
    - Downloading data one-time to GCS
- [x] Store data into a GCS bucket
- [x] Create a Python/Pyspark notebook to read data from the GCS bucket, clean the data and store into BigQuery, along with summarized data in a separate output
    - Create crucial derived variables (take more suggestions)
    - Take more suggestions as to what more can be done in the data cleaning & data transformation stage 
- [x] Convert the notebook to a Python script that can be submitted from Dataproc cluster in an automated fashion
    - Create and pass command line arguments as required
- [ ] Need more ideas how to implement dbt, docker, terraform
- [ ] Create a Prefect/Cloud Composer instance to automate the entire consumption from the public API/url on a weekly basis (since episodes are available on weekly basis)
- [x] Create a looker studio dashboard to showcase the latest episode info, high level KPIs
